<p>This&nbsp;Wednesday, October 14th, is LigerBots Parents Night! Parents Night is a special meeting meant for the parents of LigerBots team members to learn everything they need to know about the team. At Parents Night, we will go over the team&#39;s structure and schedule, talk about participation requirements, explain rules and procedures, and go over the flow of the year, including our build and competition seasons. We urge at least one parent per family to attend, as the information we will be going over is very important, however we understand if you cannot make it due to prior arrangements.</p>

<p>Parents Night will be held from&nbsp;7:00&nbsp;to 8:30, on&nbsp;October 14th&nbsp;in the Film Lecture Hall at North.&nbsp;The film lecture hall is the first room to the left from the Tiger Drive entrance.</p>

<p>Are you interested in robotics for your elementary or middle school student?</p>

<p>The LigerBots invite you to find out more at an information night for FIRST LEGO League (FLL&reg;) - robotics for 4-8th grade.</p>

<p>Wednesday, June&nbsp;24th<br />
7-9 pm<br />
Newton North High School<br />
Film Lecture Hall</p>

<p>For directions, see this <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/d/edit?mid=zxD5aIyoOQF4.kKJHm1QG3wSY" target="_blank">map</a>. 
The Film Lecture Hall is located just off the main school lobby. There should be plenty of parking off of Elm Rd (enter from Lowell or Walnut Streets).</p>

<p>In FLL, teams of up to 10 students, ages 9-14, are immersed in real world science and technology challenges. Teams research and design their own solution to a current scientific question or problem and build autonomous LEGO&nbsp;robots that perform a series of missions. This year&#39;s challenge is <a href="http://www.firstlegoleague.org/challenge/2015trashtrek" target="_blank">Trash Trek</a>.</p>

<p>For more info, you can send an email to <a href="cdn-cgi/l/email-protection/index.html#12747e7e527e7b757760707d66613c717d7f"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="95f3f9f9d5f9fcf2f0e7f7fae1e6bbf6faf8">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">

<p>During our competition at Northeastern from March 27-28, FRC team 2877, the LigerBots, were chosen to be part of the second seed alliance along with team 1768 and 663; with our new teammates, we made it all the way to the finals which ended in two very close matches. After our performance at Northeastern, our team moved on to the regional championships at WPI which took place from April 9 to 11. After an intense series of 120 qualification matches, The LigerBots became the captain of the sixth seed alliance and chose team 230 and 558 to participate with us. During Quarterfinals match 2, the LigerBots received a standing ovation when
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X-IgM9Dp7-A&feature=youtu.be&t=1m12s" target="_blank">we righted Team 558, Robo Squad&#39;s, robot</a> after they had tipped over. The competition at WPI was intense and we congratulate all 60 teams that participated.</p>

<p>During the awards ceremony, the LigerBots won the regional Chairman&#39;s award and secured our place as one of the top 10 New England teams to qualify for St. Louis. The Chairman&rsquo;s Award is given once at each district competition for to the team that best represents a model for others to emulate, and embodies the purpose and goals of FIRST. At the regional championships, all the district winners are given a chance to compete against the other recipients; however, only four presentations are chosen to compete in St. Louis against teams from all over the world. In order to receive this prestigious award, a group of students must showcase the work they have done for the community by creating a written response to present directly to a panel of judges and to film a video demonstrating the impact we have made.</p>

<p>This year, the LigerBots are hoping to perform just as well at St. Louis, and are currently raising more funds to help get the team there.

<p>This weekend at UMass Dartmouth, the Newton LigerBots, FIRST Robotics Team 2877, turned in an excellent performance in their first district meet of the 2015 Robotics Competition season.&nbsp; The team made it all the way to semifinals in this year&rsquo;s &ldquo;Recycle Rush&rdquo; game, with their alliance finishing third in the tournament. They also won the coveted District Chairman&#39;s Award, an award celebrating FIRST teams&rsquo; efforts to spread interest in STEM in their community. The accolade also automatically advances the team and the robot to compete in the upcoming District Championship to be held at Worcester Polytechnic Institute on April 9-11, for the chance to qualify for the FIRST World Championships later this spring.</p>

<p>Also at UMass Dartmouth, three members of the team were nominated for and advanced in the competition for individual awards. Congratulations to head coach Charles Hurwitz for advancing to the district championship level for the Woodie Flowers Award for FIRST team mentor achievement, and to Max Tepermeister and Ilias Vamvakas for advancing to the district championship level for the Dean&rsquo;s List Award for FIRST team member achievement.</p>

<p>Currently, the LigerBots are ranked 44 of 175 teams in New England, with one qualifying tournament yet to be played at Northeastern University, on March 27-28. Come down to Northeastern or WPI to cheer the LigerBots on.</p>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Last year, LigerBots&nbsp;was ranked 8th in New England&nbsp;and advanced to the world championships in St. Louis. However, competition is a costly undertaking;&nbsp;on any given year, competing in the qualifiers alone costs the team around $20,000.00 between&nbsp;build costs and competition fees. Last year our costs were close to triple that amount, due to travel&nbsp;and added competition fees. Due to our high cost of operation,<strong> we count on support from our community</strong> in order for the team to continue operation. Throughout the entire month of January, the team will be having a fundraiser at Whole Foods Market on Walnut St. <strong>(916 Walnut Street, Newtonville, MA 02461)</strong>. Our goal for this fundraiser is to raise $1,000.00 by the end of the month.&nbsp;Members of the team will be&nbsp;present at Whole Foods after school&nbsp;and on weekends to talk about the team, and about FIRST. Donation coupons of varying amounts&nbsp;will be available for purchase at checkout.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Check in periodically for updates on the fundraiser, updates on the team, as well as answers to frequently asked questions.</p>

<p>Thank you for your support.</p>

<h3>Hello All! Apologies for the absence of posts last week.</h3>

<hr />
<p>We started off Monday&#39;s meeting with a name game.&nbsp;Max ran the meeting: we collected money from Candy Box sales, and discussed our upcoming fundraiser at Yogurt Beach (see the handy-dandy flyer at the bottom of the post for more info). If you can volunteer to present the robot between 5pm and 10pm this thursday, email Ben Gross at &nbsp;&lt;<a href=%22/index.html target=\"\\&quot;_blank\\&quot;\"><span class="__cf_email__" data-cfemail="ccaea9a293abbea3bfbf8ca0a5aba9beaea3b8bfe2afa3a1">[email&#160;protected]</span><script data-cfhash='f9e31' type="text/javascript">

After that we took a photo for the South yearbook and split into groups.&nbsp;</p>

<hr />
<p><strong>Outreach:</strong>&nbsp;Created a basic promotional flyer to be used for many LigerBots events. Created a basic template for this year&#39;s business plan&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Chassis:</strong>&nbsp;Started cutting the bottom plates out of plywood so it will clear the brackets.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Battery Box:</strong>&nbsp;Finished up/corrected problems in the CAD. Established need for half-inch plywood instead of three-quarters. Decided how to mount wheels. Worked on structural supports.</p>

<p><strong>Programming:</strong>&nbsp;Worked on downloading code onto the Robot.</p>

<p>Hello everyone, and welcome to the new home of the Ligerbots!</p>

<p>After a number of issues with the previous website setup the team had, we decided it would be best to move onto a newer, more reliable hosting provider, and switch to a more lightweight web platform.&nbsp; Because of that, a few things might be different now.</p>

<p>First of all, <strong>All team members need to re-register for the website by clicking on Register in the upper right.</strong></p>

<p>Second of all, It is recommended that everybody uses a modern browser, as this website utilizes a number of features that may not be available in browsers that do not support HTML5 or CSS3.</p>

<p>Third of all, if you break the website, please let one of the webmasters (Max, Paul, or Nicholas) know, so we can fix the issue ASAP.&nbsp; Or just don&#39;t break the website in the first place.&nbsp; That would be nice.</p>

<p>Fourth, if your job for this year is to post content to the website, please contact one of the website administrators (Executives, IT Team members, and coaches) so that we can give you permission to post on the website.</p>

<p>Fifth, There are still a few features of the website that are under construction and/or are not fully functional yet.&nbsp; If there is a feature you would like added to the website, or a feature that is behaving strangely, feel free to contact Nick or Max and we&#39;ll get it sorted out for you in no time at all.</p>

<p>That&#39;s all you need to know for now, and I hope the website works out for everybody!&nbsp; See you all at the next meeting!</p>

<p>&nbsp;- Nicholas</p>
