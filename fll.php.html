immerses teams of up to 10 students, ages 9-14, in
real-world scientific and technological problems.  Teams research and design
solutions to a scientific question or problem and build autonomous LEGO robots
that compete in performing assigned missions.  This year's challenge is Trash
Trek.  Experience in FIRST LEGO League prepares students well for
high-school-level robotics with the LigerBots.</p>

<p>The LigerBots hosted an FLL info night on June 24th. Here is the summary of that meeting;
the <a href="img/docs/FLL_Gateway_to_FIRST_Robotics.pdf" target="_blank">full presentation can be found here</a>.</p>

<li>The LigerBots do not currently directly run elementary school or middle
school programs, but we are committed to doing what we can to support such
programs. To start with, we are setting ourselves up as an information
clearinghouse. We will also support coaches with figuring out how to get
going. We will post all the information, including the presentation from the
24th, on this web site at <a href="fll.php.html">http://ligerbots.org/fll.php</a></li>
<br/>

<li>The FLL challenge consists of a robot game and a project. The robot game is
played on a 4'x8' field, has LEGO challenges (like moving a ball, flipping a
switch). The project is to identify a real world problem (within guidelines
provided by FIRST), propose a solution, and present it to the judges.</li>
<br/>

<li>Teams come and go, and there are few legacy teams with openings. New teams
are typically formed by 2-3 parents interested in providing this experience for
their kids. Teams can have up to 10 members.</li>
<br/>

<li>You do not have to be an engineer or scientist to coach a team! The
challenge is designed to be solved by 9-14 year-old kids. There are many resources
available on the web, and other coaches (and the LigerBots!) will also
help.</li>
<br/>

<li>The main requirement for forming a team is to have space for a 4'x8' game
table. Teams typically meet 1-2 times per week for 2-3 hours, and the season is
approximately 10 weeks long. The cost is $500-$1000 for the entire team (you can
either divide the cost by the number of participants or apply for grants). Of
course, if you want to spend more money, you can.</li>
